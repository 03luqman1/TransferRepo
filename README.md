To bring together your Bootstrap + HTML/HTML5 skills you have learnt so far or are learning, I want you to demonstrate your skills by creating a new single page design for our corporate website www.Leicester.gov.uk and sample content page.

 

The design should meet the following requirements / criteria:

Should contain the LCC logo
Be mobile friendly
Fully responsive
Accessibility should be taken into consideration
Correct use of tags / elements / labels etc
Keep within our corporate colour scheme (Teal), secondary colours can be your own ideas
Best practices in regards to UX / UI
